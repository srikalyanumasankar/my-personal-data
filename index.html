            <h2>Ambitions</h2>
            <p>
                My ambition is to crack JEE Advanced and gain admission to one of India’s premier institutes like IITs, particularly for theoretical physics or engineering physics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I aspire to pursue advanced research in:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Theoretical Physics:</strong> Understanding the nature of the universe, from the smallest subatomic particles to the grand scale of cosmology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantum Mechanics:</strong> Delving deeper into interpretations and applications of quantum theory to explain the fabric of reality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Mastering the tools required to model complex physical phenomena and solve abstract problems.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>My Theories</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Critique of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)</h3>
                <p>
                    The Many-Worlds Interpretation suggests that every quantum possibility is realized in separate branches of the universe. For example, in Schrödinger's cat experiment, one universe has a live cat, and another has a dead cat. While this is an elegant solution to avoid wave function collapse, I raise the following critical question:
                </p>
                <p>
                    If all possibilities exist in parallel universes, why can't we interact with alternate versions of ourselves? If my alternate self exists in a parallel universe, there should theoretically be some observable effect or interaction, even if indirect. The complete lack of such evidence undermines the plausibility of this interpretation.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Reinterpreting Schrödinger's Cat Experiment</h3>
                <p>
                    The Schrödinger's cat thought experiment presents a cat in a superposition of being alive and dead until observed. However, I argue that the cat itself serves as an observer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the box, numerous quantum interactions occur within the cat's body (e.g., biochemical reactions). These interactions effectively "observe" the state of the cat, breaking the superposition long before a human opens the box. Observation doesn't require human consciousness; it merely involves a physical interaction that localizes the wave function.

            <h2>Inspirations</h2>
            <p>
                I draw inspiration from:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Albert Einstein:</strong> His work on relativity and his ability to think beyond conventional limits inspire me to challenge existing ideas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Richard Feynman:</strong> His approach to teaching, problem-solving, and understanding quantum mechanics is a model for my learning process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stephen Hawking:</strong> His contributions to black hole physics and cosmology motivate me to explore the mysteries of the universe.</li>
